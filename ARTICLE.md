## Why I Find It Interesting

This article on Green Software Engineering opened my eyes to a critical but overlooked aspect of software development: its environmental impact. As someone studying software engineering, I assumed functionality, performance, and user experience were always the focus but this article highlighted the significance of environmental consequences and the carbon footprint of digital products.

What particularly interests me is the practical approach the article takes by first identifying the problem and then providing concrete strategies for creating more sustainable software. The discussion about energy-efficient coding practices, such as optimizing algorithms and reducing computational complexity, illustrates that sustainability can be integrated into everyday development work. The article's emphasis on the "Green Software Principles" resonates with me because it frames sustainability as a core engineering concern rather than an optional bonus. A holistic engineering mindset is important during the entire software lifecycle, from development to implementation, and this will become increasingly important and relevant in the industry.

Amena: Before reading this article, I had never heard of Green Software Engineering. As Taha previously mentioned, I had only every thought of writing efficient and optimized algorithms for the sake of performance, however this article made me realize that this approach also results in a reduction of computational waste which can therefore lower carbon emissions.
